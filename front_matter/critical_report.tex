  – & – & This mass by Reinhardt has been substantially revised by Jan Dismas Zelenka, who largely wrote the string parts and added many corrections in org. Moreover, several sections are entirely in Zelenka’s hand: Bars 30–39 in \textit{Kyrie}, bars 37–39 in \textit{Gloria}
  – & ob & The directives “Tutti” and “Vv.” in the violin parts sometimes indicate the beginning and end of segments where the oboes should play unison with the violins. Based on these directives, the oboe parts of this edition have been assembled. If a chord appears in the violin part, only the highest note is retained for the oboe part. \\
